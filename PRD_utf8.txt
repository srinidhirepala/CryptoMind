1. Product Overview
The AI Crypto Wallet Dashboard is a next-generation web application that connects to a user's MetaMask wallet and uses AI to transform raw blockchain data into clear, actionable insights. Think of it as Google Pay — but for crypto, with an AI financial advisor built in.
Most crypto dashboards show you numbers. This one explains them. A first-time crypto user should be able to connect their wallet and immediately understand what they own, what it means, and what smart moves they can make — all explained in plain English by an AI assistant.
This project is built entirely using GitHub Copilot and directly mirrors the vision of the AYA Community's own product: an AI-powered crypto wallet with lending, staking, and borrowing capabilities.

2. Problem Statement
2.1 The Problem
Crypto is powerful but deeply confusing for most people. Even experienced users struggle to:
Understand what their portfolio is actually worth in real-time
Know whether they should stake, lend, or hold their assets
Spot risky transactions or unusual wallet activity
Get personalized advice without paying for a financial advisor

2.2 The Opportunity
By combining a real MetaMask wallet connection with an AI layer, we can give every crypto user their own personal AI financial advisor — one that understands their specific portfolio and gives advice in plain language.

3. Solution
A web dashboard where users:
Connect their MetaMask wallet with one click
See their full portfolio with live prices and AI-generated summaries
Chat with an AI assistant about their crypto — &quot;Should I stake my ETH?&quot;
Get risk analysis and staking/lending recommendations
View transaction history explained in plain English

The AI doesn't just show data — it interprets it, explains it, and guides the user like a knowledgeable friend who happens to understand DeFi.

4. Features &amp; Scope
4.1 Core Features (Must Have — MVP)
Feature 1: MetaMask Wallet Connection
One-click MetaMask connect button on landing page
Display connected wallet address (truncated: 0x1234...abcd)
Show ETH balance and network (Mainnet / Testnet)
Disconnect option always visible
Feature 2: Live Portfolio Dashboard
Fetch token balances using Ethers.js + Alchemy/Infura RPC
Display each token: name, symbol, balance, USD value
Total portfolio value in USD with 24h change indicator
Pie chart or bar chart showing asset distribution
Live price data via CoinGecko API (free tier)
Feature 3: AI Portfolio Summary
On dashboard load, AI generates a 3-4 sentence plain-English summary of the wallet
Example: &quot;Your wallet holds $1,240 worth of crypto. Your largest holding is ETH (72%). Your portfolio is down 3.2% in the last 24 hours, primarily due to a dip in MATIC.&quot;
Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (cheap and fast)
Feature 4: AI Chat Assistant
Chat interface fixed to the right side of the dashboard
User can ask questions like: &quot;Should I stake my ETH?&quot;, &quot;What is USDC?&quot;, &quot;Is my portfolio risky?&quot;
AI has full context of the user's wallet (balances, tokens, recent transactions)
Responses are clear, jargon-free, and friendly
Disclaimer shown: &quot;This is not financial advice.&quot;
Feature 5: Transaction History
Last 10 transactions fetched from Etherscan API
Each transaction shows: date, type, amount, from/to address
AI generates a one-line plain English label for each transaction
Example: &quot;You sent 0.5 ETH to a DeFi protocol (likely a swap or deposit)&quot;
Feature 6: Staking &amp; Lending Recommendations
AI analyzes the wallet and recommends staking or lending opportunities
Example: &quot;You have 1.2 ETH idle. Consider staking it on Lido for ~4% APY.&quot;
Static recommendations for demo (no actual DeFi protocol integration needed)
Each recommendation shows estimated APY and risk level (Low / Medium / High)

4.2 Bonus Features (Nice to Have — if time permits)
Risk Score: AI assigns a risk score (1-10) to the portfolio with explanation
Dark mode toggle
Portfolio history chart (mock data is fine for demo)
Share portfolio button (generates a shareable screenshot)

8. AI Prompt Templates
8.1 Portfolio Summary Prompt
Give GitHub Copilot this prompt context when building the /api/ai-summary route:
System: You are a friendly crypto financial assistant.Analyze the user's wallet and give a 3-4 sentence plain-English summary.Be specific, use actual numbers, and avoid jargon.End with one actionable suggestion.User: Here is my wallet data:- Total Value: $1,240.50- Holdings: [{token: 'ETH', balance: 0.52, usd: 890}, ...]- 24h Change: -3.2%- Top holding: ETH (72% of portfolio)
8.2 Chat Assistant System Prompt
You are an AI crypto assistant with access to the user's wallet data.Answer questions clearly and simply. Always be helpful.For staking/lending questions, give general guidance.Always end with: 'This is not financial advice.'User wallet context: {inject wallet data as JSON here}
